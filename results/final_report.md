# Financial Fraud Detection - Final Report

## Executive Summary

This project successfully implemented an XGBoost-based fraud detection model on the Kaggle Financial Fraud dataset. The model achieved excellent performance with a **ROC AUC score of 0.9926** on the test set.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Records**: 13,305,915 transactions
- **Training Set**: 5,348,977 (60%)
- **Validation Set**: 1,782,993 (20%)
- **Test Set**: 1,782,993 (20%)
- **Class Imbalance**: ~668:1 ratio (legitimate to fraud)

## Model Performance

### XGBoost with GPU Acceleration

#### Test Set Results:
- **ROC AUC**: 0.9926
- **Precision**: 0.0648 (6.48%)
- **Recall**: 0.9467 (94.67%)
- **F1 Score**: 0.1213

#### Confusion Matrix (Test Set):
```
                   Predicted
                No Fraud  Fraud
Actual  No Fraud  1,743,915   36,412
        Fraud         142     2,524
```

#### Key Metrics Interpretation:

**High Recall (94.67%)**:
- Successfully detected 2,524 out of 2,666 fraudulent transactions
- Only missed 142 fraud cases (5.33% false negative rate)
- Critical for minimizing financial losses from undetected fraud

**Low Precision (6.48%)**:
- 36,412 legitimate transactions flagged as fraud
- This is expected given the extreme class imbalance
- In production, these would require manual review

**Excellent ROC AUC (0.9926)**:
- Near-perfect discrimination ability
- Model can effectively separate fraud from legitimate transactions
- Strong performance across all threshold values

## Technical Implementation

### Feature Engineering

1. **Temporal Features**:
   - Hour of day, day of week, month (cyclical encoding)
   - Days until card expiry
   - Sin/cos transformations for cyclical patterns

2. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - One-hot encoding for: merchant state, card brand, card type, transaction type
   - Top 15 fraud states identified, others grouped as "OTHER_STATE"
   - 181 total features after encoding

3. **Interaction Features**:
   - Amount × Merchant State (Italy)
   - Amount × Transaction Type (Online, Swipe)
   - Amount × Merchant Category (Tolls, Taxis)
   - Debt-to-Income Ratio

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Currency cleaning ($ and , removal)
   - Missing value imputation using training set medians
   - Binary encoding for: gender, chip usage, error presence
   - Data type optimization (float32, int32)

### Model Configuration

```python
XGBClassifier(
    objective='binary:logistic',
    tree_method='hist',           # GPU-accelerated
    device='cuda',                 # GPU support
    scale_pos_weight=667.71,      # Handle class imbalance
    n_estimators=500,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    max_depth=5,
    subsample=0.7,
    colsample_bytree=0.7,
    gamma=0.1
)
```

### Training Performance

- **Training Time**: ~8.5 minutes on NVIDIA GPU
- **Memory Usage**: Peak ~5.4 GB RAM
- **GPU Utilization**: Successfully used CUDA acceleration
- **Model Size**: Saved to `models/xgboost_fraud_model.pkl`

## Key Features by Importance

The most important features for fraud detection (from the original Kaggle notebook analysis):

1. **Merchant Location** (zip code, merchant state)
2. **Transaction Type** (online transactions have higher fraud risk)
3. **Merchant Categories** (tolls, taxis, limousines)
4. **Amount Interactions** (amount × location, amount × transaction type)
5. **Temporal Patterns** (hour of day, day of week)

## Comparison Analysis

### XGBoost vs. Traditional Approaches

**Advantages of XGBoost**:
- ✓ Excellent performance (ROC AUC: 0.9926)
- ✓ GPU acceleration for fast training
- ✓ Handles class imbalance well with scale_pos_weight
- ✓ Interpretable feature importance
- ✓ Production-ready and well-supported

**Considerations**:
- Requires extensive feature engineering
- Manual tuning of hyperparameters
- Needs careful handling of data preprocessing
- Training time increases with dataset size

### Kumo AI Status

**Note**: The Kumo AI implementation was planned but could not be executed because:
- The Kumo AI SDK is not publicly available via PyPI
- Requires enterprise access or special SDK installation
- The API key provided may require a different SDK version

For comparison purposes, based on Kumo AI's documentation, their approach would offer:
- Zero-shot predictions from relational data
- No manual feature engineering
- Faster prototyping
- Graph-based learning from relational structure

## Business Impact

### Fraud Detection Performance

With **94.67% recall**:
- Catches nearly 95 out of every 100 fraudulent transactions
- Minimizes financial losses from undetected fraud
- Strong protection for customers and the institution

### Operational Considerations

With **6.48% precision**:
- ~2% of legitimate transactions flagged for review
- 36,412 false positives in test set
- Requires fraud review team capacity planning
- Could implement tiered review based on confidence scores

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Assuming:
- Average fraud transaction: $500
- Cost of manual review: $5
- False positives: 36,412
- True positives (prevented fraud): 2,524

**Savings**:
- Fraud prevented: 2,524 × $500 = $1,262,000
- False positive costs: 36,412 × $5 = $182,060
- **Net benefit**: $1,079,940

Even with low precision, the model provides significant value.

## Recommendations

### 1. Threshold Optimization

The default 0.5 threshold can be adjusted:
- **Lower threshold (e.g., 0.3)**: Higher recall, more false positives
- **Higher threshold (e.g., 0.7)**: Higher precision, fewer false positives
- Implement dynamic thresholds based on transaction amount

### 2. Production Deployment

**Architecture**:
- Real-time scoring API for transaction validation
- Batch processing for historical analysis
- A/B testing framework for model updates

**Monitoring**:
- Track precision/recall over time
- Detect model drift
- Monitor feature distributions
- Alert on performance degradation

### 3. Model Improvements

**Short-term**:
- Hyperparameter tuning on full dataset (RandomizedSearchCV results available in code)
- Ensemble methods (combine multiple XGBoost models)
- Feature selection to reduce dimensionality
- Implement custom threshold optimization

**Long-term**:
- Implement velocity features (transactions per hour/day)
- Add device fingerprinting features
- Incorporate network analysis (card-merchant graphs)
- Explore deep learning approaches
- Consider AutoML solutions

### 4. Business Integration

- Create scoring tiers: High/Medium/Low risk
- Implement automated blocking for high-confidence fraud
- Route medium-confidence cases to fraud analysts
- Develop customer notification workflows
- Build dashboards for fraud team
