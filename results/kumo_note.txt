Kumo AI SDK Note
==================

The Kumo AI SDK is not publicly available via pip install kumo.
The package named 'kumo' on PyPI is a different package, not the Kumo AI fraud detection SDK.

To use Kumo AI, you would need:
1. Access to the actual Kumo AI SDK (likely requires enterprise access)
2. Valid API credentials for the Kumo AI platform
3. Proper SDK installation instructions from Kumo AI
