# Financial Fraud Detection - Final Comparison Report
**XGBoost vs. KumoRFM**

## Executive Summary

This project successfully implemented and compared two fraud detection approaches on the Kaggle Financial Fraud dataset (8.9M transactions):

1. **XGBoost** - Traditional gradient boosting with extensive feature engineering
2. **KumoRFM** - Relational Foundation Model with zero-shot predictions

## Results Overview

### XGBoost Performance

| Metric | Validation | Test |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **ROC AUC** | 0.9925 | **0.9926** |
| **Precision** | 6.40% | 6.48% |
| **Recall** | 93.29% | **94.67%** |
| **F1 Score** | 11.98% | 12.13% |

**Training Details:**
- Dataset: 8.9M transactions (0.15% fraud rate = 668:1 imbalance)
- Training time: ~8.5 minutes on NVIDIA GPU
- GPU-accelerated (tree_method='hist', device='cuda')
- 181 features after feature engineering
- Class imbalance handled via scale_pos_weight

### KumoRFM Performance

**Status:** ✅ Successfully ran but inconclusive results

**Limitations Encountered:**
- Sample size (1,000 transactions) contained **zero fraud cases**
- With 0.15% fraud rate, need ~670 transactions to expect 1 fraud case
- Larger samples cause query length limits in PQL
- Results: ROC AUC = NaN (no positive samples in test set)

**What Worked:**
- ✅ SDK initialized successfully
- ✅ Graph materialized (8.9M nodes, 35.7M edges)
- ✅ Predictions generated in 5.96 seconds
- ✅ Demonstrated relational modeling capability

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. XGBoost Strengths

**Excellent Fraud Detection:**
- 94.67% recall means catches 95% of fraud
- Near-perfect ROC AUC (0.9926)
- Only 142 fraud cases missed out of 2,666

**Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
- Temporal features (hour, day, cyclical encoding)
- Categorical encoding (merchant state, card type, etc.)
- Interaction features (amount × location, amount × type)
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Missing value imputation

**Production-Ready:**
- Model persistence (1.2MB pickle file)
- Reproducible results
- GPU-accelerated for scale
- Well-documented code

### 2. XGBoost Trade-offs

**Low Precision (6.48%):**
- 36,412 false positives out of 1.78M test transactions
- ~2% of legitimate transactions flagged
- Expected given extreme class imbalance

**Manual Effort:**
- Required extensive feature engineering
- Multiple preprocessing steps
- Hyperparameter tuning needed
- Domain knowledge for interaction features

### 3. KumoRFM Strengths

**Zero-Shot Capability:**
- No feature engineering required
- No manual preprocessing needed
- Relational graph automatically constructed
- Foundation model approach

**Graph Modeling:**
- Successfully modeled 3 tables with 4 relationships
- Temporal graph from 1991-2020
- Automatic primary key detection
- Foreign key relationship inference

**Speed:**
- Graph materialization: 2.65 seconds
- Predictions: 5.96 seconds
- Fast prototyping cycle

### 4. KumoRFM Limitations (For This Dataset)

**Extreme Class Imbalance:**
- 0.15% fraud rate too low for small samples
- Need 10K+ samples to get sufficient fraud cases
- PQL query length limits prevent large IN clauses

**Query Constraints:**
- IN clause with 1000 IDs = ~10K characters
- 100K IDs would exceed practical query limits
- Alternative approaches needed for large-scale inference

**Evaluation Challenges:**
- Sampled data had zero fraud cases
- Cannot calculate meaningful metrics
- Would need stratified sampling or full dataset prediction

## Technical Implementation

### XGBoost Architecture

```python
XGBClassifier(
    objective='binary:logistic',
    tree_method='hist',  # GPU
    device='cuda',
    scale_pos_weight=667.71,
    n_estimators=500,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    max_depth=5
)
```

**Pipeline:**
1. Load & merge 5 data sources
2. Split: 60% train, 20% val, 20% test (stratified)
3. Feature engineering (numerical, temporal, categorical)
4. One-hot encoding with top-N categorical grouping
5. Interaction feature creation
6. Train with GPU acceleration
7. Evaluate on held-out test set

### KumoRFM Architecture

```python
# Graph structure
rfm.LocalGraph.from_data({
    'transactions': transactions_df,
    'cards': cards_df,
    'users': users_df
}, infer_metadata=True)

# Links
transactions -> cards (via card_id)
transactions -> users (via client_id)
cards -> users (via client_id)

# PQL Query
PREDICT transactions.is_fraud
FOR transactions.transaction_id IN (...)
```

**Pipeline:**
1. Load & prepare data with fraud labels
2. Create LocalGraph with automatic metadata inference
3. Define foreign key relationships
4. Initialize KumoRFM model on graph
5. Generate predictions via PQL query
6. Evaluate results

## Business Impact Analysis

### XGBoost Deployment Value

**Fraud Prevention:**
- Catches 94.67% of fraud (2,524/2,666 cases)
- Average fraud: $500 → **$1.26M saved**

**Operational Cost:**
- 36,412 false positives to review
- Review cost: $5/case → **$182K cost**
- **Net benefit: $1.08M**

**Customer Experience:**
- 2% false positive rate
- Requires review process for flagged transactions
- Can implement tiered approach (auto-block high confidence)

### KumoRFM Potential Value

**Faster Prototyping:**
- No feature engineering = faster iteration
- Graph-based modeling = easier to understand
- Foundation model = transfer learning possible

**Better for:**
- Quick explorations
- Recommendation systems (not tested here)
- Scenarios with balanced classes
- Datasets with rich relational structure

## Recommendations

### For Production Fraud Detection

**Use XGBoost** given:
- Proven performance (ROC AUC 0.9926)
- Handles extreme imbalance well
- Production-ready implementation
- Strong recall (94.67%)

**Optimizations:**
1. Threshold tuning for business requirements
2. Ensemble with other models
3. Real-time scoring API
4. Monitoring for model drift

**Future Experiments:**
1. Test on balanced subsets (oversample fraud)
2. Use for related predictions (user behavior, transaction amount)
3. Evaluate on recommendation tasks
4. Compare training time vs. XGBoost on full dataset

**Addressing Limitations:**
1. Implement batch prediction API (not IN clause)
2. Use stratified sampling for evaluation
3. Test on datasets with higher positive class rates
4. Explore alternative PQL patterns
